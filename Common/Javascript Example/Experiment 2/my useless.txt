an artificial intelligence enabled trash boat 
is being developed 
which could map the water bodies 
and travel into urban drains.

The boat will identify 
floating trash 
and collect it.

To travel through drainage systems, 
the boat has to be as small as possible. 
Hence there will be no trash bin mounted on it.

To solve trash storage problems, 
a special trash storage boat 
is designed 
which could store 
large amount of trash. 

The storage boat 
and the trash boat 
will work as master-slave, 
where one master could have multiple slaves, 
and both will track each otherâ€™s locations.

this is particularly the slave boat. 
where the rear has all the electronic modules. 
the mid part has this empty space where the trash 
can be trapped. 
the front part is connected to two motors, 
which help lift the front part 
allowing the floating trash 
to enter the body.

the master boat is yet to be implemented.

For each region of a water body, 
there will be 1:N master slave system.

The slaves will scan the drainage pipes and tunnels for trash, 
collect it, 
and report back to the master.

The master will pick up the trash 
and put it into its trash bin.

This process will keep repeating until the trash bin on master is not full.

The trash boats will have GPS 
and camera mounted on it, 
and use AI / ML algorithms to identify the trash.
